# FaceArt
One of the main goals of the website is to give people an idea of using technology as art. The primary goal of the website is to show products people can buy when using their own facial landmarks as a painting. This is the first version and will be a fist step in integrating an automated facial analysis module to antomate the production of Personalized portraits using facial landmarks.


## UX
The main layout is taken form the Boutique Ado project from Code Institute. It has been adjusted for this current project. Mainly the color scheme used is dark, this to enhance the mystery around the technology used and the creation of anonimity with the use of facial landmarks for portraits.

The reason to use the template of Code Institute is that Code Insitute has a long history of trail and error, and thus should come uop with the most efficient lay out of the webshop. 

The Landing page is a common image of a landmarked face and should give people an idea of what their wall decoration would look like in close-up.

# Features
The first part is the productspage. Here you can find all products. When clicking on different categories in the manu you can select products you are interesed in. There are three different sizes for the wall decorations. Small Medium and Large. In addition there are four different materials you can choose from: Canvas, Wood, Aluminium and Plexiglass.

The images give you a nice idea of the size of the image. 

In addition to the you can also buy a cup and a glass with facial landmarks engraved. The specials are two different faces combined into a diptych also possible in the materrials above and differnt sizes.

Current users can login and create an account, see their past orders and their profile information. 

# Features left to Implement
The next main implementation would be letting customers upload their image to be analyzed to get an idea what their face would look like on the products ordered.

As can be seen in the app, testing was not done properly at the end. During the whole developement tests were done to see if everything worked smoothly.

This apparently was caused by an issue in Gitpod with not remembering the KEYS.
